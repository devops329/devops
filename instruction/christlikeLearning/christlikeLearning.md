# Christlike learning

üîë **Key points**

- Gratitude, inspiration, and action are divine traits of successful software engineers.
- Apply these principles as part of your work in this course.

---

Humility is a foundational requirement for a learning mindset. By intentionally acknowledging the source of our blessings and opportunities we approach learning with eagerness and openness. This then allows us to receive the influence and inspiration of the divine and in turn apply our talents in the service of righteousness.

This can be summarized by three principles to apply in all of our educational and temporal endeavors.

1. **Gratitude** - Acknowledging the source of our ability to learn and contribute.
1. **Inspiration** - Seeking for guidance to see things clearly and with insight.
1. **Action** - The integrity to use our acquired talents for the betterment of the eternal.

## Founding our learning with gratitude

Creating an environment where we can reason and work with a positive mindset is essential to our eternal progression.

> ‚ÄúWe can lift ourselves, and others as well, when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude.‚Äù
>
> Thomas S. Monson - _[An Attitude of Gratitude](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1992/04/an-attitude-of-gratitude)_

Likewise,

> The prophet Alma taught, ‚ÄúWhen thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God‚Äù ([Alma 37:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.37?lang=eng#p37)). And in modern revelation the Lord declared that ‚Äúhe who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold‚Äù ([D&C 78:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.19?lang=eng#p19)).
>
> Dallin H. Oaks - _[Give Thanks in All Things](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2003/04/give-thanks-in-all-things)_

Gratitude removes the obstacles that pride creates. It allows us to see things as they really are and explore the path forward with the purest of motives. That is why it is essential to begin any endeavor, educational or otherwise, with a spirit of thankfulness to the source from whom all blessing flow.

## Learning by the inspiration of the Spirit

We are promised that with the Spirit's influence we can learn all things. When instructing Oliver Cowdery on how to gain knowledge, the Lord said:

> ‚Äú... verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall **you receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith**, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive ...‚Äù

[_Doctrine and Covenants 8:1_](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8)

I have found this to be true. When I put forth my best efforts, combined with earnestly seeking the company of the spirit, I feel the walls of ignorance fall, and comprehension enter in. It does require me to study it out in my mind, but there is no doubt that the spirit clarifies concepts and opens my thoughts to previously unconsidered paths.

- Approach your learning with a desire to obtain knowledge and skills so that you can further the Kingdom of God.
- Consider the eternal value and impact of your learning.
- Keep your covenants so that you are worthy of the inspiration of the Spirit.

## Letting the Spirit inspire our actions

When Karl G. Maeser asked President Brigham Young how he should approach his work, he received the following response.

> ‚ÄúBrother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables **without the Spirit of God**.‚Äù

[_Karl G. Maeser: A Biography_](https://www.amazon.com/Karl-G-Maeser-Biography-Reinhard/dp/B000T664LY)

This suggests that as we seek to do our work, including software engineering, we must combine it with the inspiration and companionship of the Spirit. Following the pattern of President Young's advice, no algorithm should be considered or line of code written without the Spirit of God. Doing this will allow us to unleash our greatest potential and fulfill our covenants to build the Kingdom of God.

Without the influence of the Spirit in our work we are left to the arm of the flesh. With the influence of the Spirit, the eternal and the present combine in awesome power. In my professional career there are numerous occasions where I was able to deliver significant value to my employer, and the world, by seeking for and following the spirit.

- Start your day by pleading to be able to do His work and receive His inspiration.
- Embrace the knowledge that there is no difference between your eternal work and your earthly work.
- Guide every decision with the influence of your covenants and discipleship.
