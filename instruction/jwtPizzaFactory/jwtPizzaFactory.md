It is important that you provide accurate contact information for a location that you check frequently because this is what your peers will use to connect with you. Without proper information you may not be able to complete key deliverables.

After you have provided and verified your information you can use the Vendor Dashboard to take the actions necessary to complete the course. This allows you to do the following:

1. Create badges for display in your CI pipelines.
1. Request chaos testing.
1. Find partners for activities such as penetration testing.
