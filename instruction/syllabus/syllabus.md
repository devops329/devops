# CS 329 Syllabus - Quality Assurance & DevOps

## Course Description

This course provides you with the experience and skills necessary to deploy, manage, and ensure the quality of a modern software application. This includes automated testing at all levels, continuous integration and deployment pipelines, application monitoring, failure detection, alerting, and elastic application scaling.

## Course Content

If you find errors in the content then we encourage you to fork the content repository and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). That way everyone benefits from your work, and you are listed as a contributor on a significant open source project.

##  Prerequisites

CS 260

In this course we assume you have previously taken the web programming course in which you learned the basic concepts of building and hosting web applications.

##  Course Learning Outcomes

- **Quality**: Implement comprehensive automated testing strategies, including unit, UI, E2E, performance, and load testing.
- **Deployment**: Deploy various automated CI/CD pipeline strategies to reliably deliver software that is resilient, scalable, and secure.
- **Management**: Monitor, detect anomalies, alter, and automatically correct system behavior.
- **Curious**: Characterize and address gaps in understanding related to DevOps techniques and principles.
- **Creative**: Discuss and generate alternate DevOps designs.
- **Collaborative**: Work as a team to discover DevOps design weaknesses.

##  Course Materials

You do not need to purchase any textbooks for this class. All instruction materials are accessible from the course GitHub account.

To host your web applications, you are required to rent a web server and purchase a domain name from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cost for this is estimated to be between $30 and $150 depending on your use of AWS and how often you have your services running.

##  Technology Needs

You will need a reasonably current computer to complete the programming projects for this course. A minimum of 8 gigabytes of RAM is recommended, as well several gigabytes of free disk space.

If you do not have a computer of your own, you can rent one from the [BYU Office of Information Technology (OIT)](https://itsurplus.byu.edu/rentals).

## Late Policy

Your success in this course is primarily based upon timely execution. Staying on track results in an enjoyable, positive experience. Once you get behind in the course it is extremely difficult to catch up.

You are given 2 late days at the start of the course. You can gain as many as 2 additional late days for each day that you turn in a deliverable early. Late days are deducted for each day you turn in a deliverable late. If you have zero late days for a late assignment you will receive zero points for that assignment.

Any assignments not submitted by the last day of class will receive zero points.

See the [late policy](../latePolicy/latePolicy.md) instruction for a full description of the policy.

## Accommodations

In order to receive accommodations beyond the existing late policy you must complete a [Request for Accommodation](https://forms.gle/8RsmDmUntnUC9tZW7) before the due date of the deliverable or exam. This applies for those who have university approved accommodations and for those who experience difficulties that are outside their control such as sickness, injury, or disaster.

## Commit Policy

It is critical that you develop good software engineering practices. Your GitHub commit history should demonstrate every step of your work in this class. If your history does not prove your ownership of the work you may be given a failing grade for the class.

## TAs

TAs are here to help you complete the projects and answer your questions. However, we are often given tasks by your instructor that may be time-sensitive. If you come into the TA lab, do not be shy in interrupting us to ask for help. However, please understand if we ask you to wait for a moment if we are trying to complete another task.

Also, please understand that even though the TAs have taken the class and passed with very high marks they do not know everything, nor can they explain every bug. We will try to help you, but if we do not understand the bug, we might refer you to another TA or the instructor. We might even offer suggestions (guesses) on what we would do if we ran into that bug.

In summary, TAs are here to help but not to hold your hand and take away the learning experience of programming and debugging. But when you are stuck, do not hesitate to come in and ask for help.

## **Doing Your Own Work**

All deliverables must be your own work. You are encouraged to study with other students, discuss concepts, ideas, and general approaches. However, you may not submit someone else's solution as your deliverable or provide your solution to other students. You may use generative AI as an assistant when developing your deliverables.

In order to demonstrate original authorship, you must:

1. Have a clear and detailed Git commit history that demonstrates the creative progression of the deliverable
1. Be able to demonstrate a complete understanding of everything that you submit
1. Be able to reproduce the submission without external assistance in the presence of a TA or instructor
1. If you cannot do this then it will be considered as if you had submitted someone else's work.

**Violations of this policy will result in all involved students failing the course and the possibility of further action at the university level.**

##   Grade Scheme

The following grading standards will be used in this class:

| Grade | Range             |

##  BYU Online Policies

### Statement on Belonging 

We are united by our common primary identity as children of God (Acts 17:29; Psalm 82:6) and our commitment to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ (BYU Mission Statement). We strive to create a community of belonging composed of students, faculty, and staff whose hearts are knit together in love (Mosiah 18:21) where

- all relationships reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor (BYU Mission Statement);
- we value and embrace the variety of individual characteristics, life experiences and circumstances, perspectives, talents, and gifts of each member of the community and the richness and strength they bring to our community (1 Corinthians 12:12–27);
- our interactions create and support an environment of belonging (Ephesians 2:19); and
- the full realization of each student’s divine potential is our central focus (BYU Mission Statement).

### Honor Code

In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and my own expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at [801-422-2847](tel:8014222847) if you have questions about those standards.

### Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct

Brigham Young University prohibits all forms of sexual harassment—including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking on the basis of sex—by its personnel and students and in all its education programs or activities. University policy requires all faculty members to promptly report incidents of sexual harassment that come to their attention in any way and encourages reports by students who experience or become aware of sexual harassment. Incidents should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at [title9@byu.edu](mailto:title9@byu.edu) or [801-422-8692](tel:8014228692) or 1320 WSC. Reports may also be submitted online to the [Title IX Office](https://titleix.byu.edu/report) or by calling [1-888-238-1062](tel:18882381062) (24 hours a day). BYU offers a number of resources and services for those affected by sexual harassment. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, BYU’s Sexual Assault Survivor Advocacy Services (SASAS) can help. SASAS can provide information, support, and connection to the resources you may need. SASAS services are free and confidential.

SASAS Contact Information

- Phone: 801.422.9071
- Email: advocate@byu.edu
- Web: https://advocates.byu.edu/

Additional information about sexual harassment, the university's Sexual Harassment Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found in the University Catalog, by visiting [the Title IX Office website](http://titleix.byu.edu/), or by contacting the university's Title IX Coordinator.

### Student Disability

Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC) located at 2170 WSC, or call [801-422-2767](tel:8014222767). Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at [801-422-5895](tel:8014225895), D-285 ASB.

In this spirit, BYU Online aspires to improve web accessibility for users. While not required by law, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Levels A and AA provide a wide range of helpful recommendations to make web content more accessible. BYU Online strives to apply WCAG 2.0 recommendations where feasible but may deviate from any recommendations that would result in an undue hardship to BYU Online or alterations to program and course content and objectives. If you have questions about accessibility, or if you need to report problems with any accessibility features, please see our [Accessibilities and Accommodations Web Page.](https://is.byu.edu/support/accommodations&sa=D&ust=1567809961599000)

### Academic Honesty

The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to _be honest_. Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life's work, but also to build character. "President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education" ("The Aims of a BYU Education," p. 6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based on that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.

### Online Exams and Proctoring (If Applicable)

Maintaining academic integrity is a fundamental expectation at BYU and in this course, and all students are required to uphold honesty and ethical behavior in their work. To ensure a fair and secure testing environment, this course may utilize remote online proctoring software to monitor and record online exams. The proctoring software is designed to verify your identity, monitor the testing environment, and ensure no unauthorized materials or supports are used during the exam.

By taking this course, you agree to comply with the proctoring guidelines and all BYU Academic policies. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure a quiet, distraction-free environment during exams and to adhere to all rules and instructions provided. Please be aware that any violations of academic honesty, including but not limited to cheating or the use of unauthorized resources, will be addressed and may result in penalties, including failing the exam or course in accordance with the BYU's Academic Honesty Policy.

**Honorlock**

If your course has online proctored exams, your course will utilize Honorlock to proctor these exams.  Honorlock provides remote proctoring services that uses artificial intelligence (AI) software and live proctors. The blend of AI remote proctoring software and live proctors aim to protect academic integrity and to support students through a successful completion of the exam. If the AI detects potential issues, it alerts a live test proctor to review the situation and intervene if needed.

**Preparing for your exam**

Honorlock does not require students to create an account, download a separate web browser, or schedule an appointment with Honorlock in advance. Students are responsible for ensuring their computer, browser and internet meet the [minimum system requirement](https://honorlock.com/support)s necessary for the completion of the online exam.

Before you begin your exam, you will be required to have the following:

- Computer or Chromebook
- Working webcam and microphone
- Stable internet connection
- Google Chrome browser
- Download the Honorlock Browser Extenstion
- Some form of picture ID (e.g. School ID, driver’s license, etc.)

When you are ready to complete your exam Honorlock will walk you through an authentication process which includes the following:

- Taking a picture of yourself and showing some form of ID
- Complete a 360-degree room scan of your testing environment

Honorlock records your exam session through your webcam, microphone, and recording your screen. Honorlock can detect violations on exam rules and instructions, suspicious eye movement, dual monitors and search-engine use.

**Proctoring Acknowledgement Quiz**

Before accessing the academic course exams, you will complete a "Proctoring Acknowledgement" quiz. You will be required to acknowledge that you have read and understand the [BYU Academic Honesty Policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/academic-honesty-policy) as well as exam rules and guidelines. The acknowledgment quiz will also serve as an opportunity to help you navigate taking your exam through Honorlock.

**Honorlock Support and Resources**

Honorlock support is available 24/7/365. If you encounter any issues, you may contact them through live chat on the [support page](https://honorlock.com/support 'https://honorlock.com/support') or within the exam itself. Some guides you should review are [Honorlock System Requirements](https://honorlock.kb.help/minimum-system-requirements/ 'https://honorlock.kb.help/minimum-system-requirements/'), [Honorlock FAQs for Test Takers](https://honorlock.kb.help/honorlock-faqs-for-test-takers/ 'https://honorlock.kb.help/honorlock-faqs-for-test-takers/'), and [How to Use Honorlock](https://honorlock.kb.help/how-to-use-honorlock-test-takers/ 'https://honorlock.kb.help/how-to-use-honorlock-test-takers/').

### Plagiarism

Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include the following:

- **Direct Plagiarism**: The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source.
- **Paraphrased Plagiarism**: The paraphrasing, without acknowledgment, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author's own.
- **Plagiarism Mosaic**: The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one's own without acknowledging the source.
- **Insufficient Acknowledgement**: The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source.

Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student's work and submitting it as one's own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.

### Respectful Environment

> "Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others. . . . We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another."
>
> — President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010

> "Occasionally, we . . . hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets."
>
> — Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010

### Mental Health Concerns

Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students' academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (1500 WSC, [801-422-3035](tel:8014223035)) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost to full-time students. For general information please visit the [BYU Counseling and Psychological Services website](https://caps.byu.edu); for more immediate concerns please visit the [Helping Distressed Students at BYU web page](http://help.byu.edu/).

### Inappropriate Use of Course Materials

All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, or audio and video recordings) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course.
