# Versioning

### Tagging suggestions

It’s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter v. Some good tag names might be v1.0.0 or v2.3.4. If the tag isn’t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be v0.2.0-alpha or v5.9-beta.3.
