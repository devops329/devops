## Who to ask questions

You have a lot of resources to help you find answers. Here is the order that you should use them.

1. **Yourself** - You will learn more and find great satisfaction in answering your own question. When you feel like you need help with a question the first thing you should do is stop, take a breath, and think. How can I answer this question myself? Can you break apart the problem into smaller pieces and find the answer by solving just a part of the question? Can you simplify the problem by ruling everything out except one variable and then answering that? You will be surprised how often, and quickly, you will find the answer.
1. **The Oracle** - ChatGPT and Google are your friends. Think like a webpage and use search terms that are unique to the webpage you are hoping to find. Avoid terms that are common or used by different industries. With technical questions, especially the technologies in this instruction, it will be very rare that you cannot find your answer with searching. The trick will be to make sure that the answer is credible, and that it is relevant. Answers for older, or newer, versions of a technology, or blindly trusting AI hallucinations, will send you down a rabbit hole.
1. **Peers** - You have a whole class full of friends. We are all in this together. Get on Discord or talk to someone in class. More than likely there is someone with the same question as you. However, you should also **assume** that the question has already been asked. Use the search functionality of Discord. Make sure you are in the right channel. Look up at the previous discussions to see if the answer is already there. If all that fails, then ask the question.
1. **TA** - These are smart people who have been where you are and want to help you succeed. Check the TA hours and contact them on Discord or in person. Respect their time by researching the question and come prepared to ask a clear question.
1. **Instructor** - The instructor is there for **you**. Asking for help in class, after class, or during office hours has a good chance of helping you find an answer. This is especially true if you have already tried the other methods. If the instructor can't help you, then at least you will get to know each other better.

## How to ask questions

Learning how to ask questions might be the most important thing you learn. The better your question, the better your answer will be. Otherwise, you end up with an answer like 42, and you do not even know what you were asking.

1. Clearly define and phrase your question. Sometimes this alone will give you an answer.
1. Use the clearly defined question to research for more information.
1. Give ample background. Assume the person you are asking is not looking at your computer, doesn't know what you are working on, and doesn't know what you know. Because they don't. Saying "It doesn't work" provides no value. It isn't even a question. Instead, give the background in as much detail as possible. Explain what you tried already and what the result was.
1. Screenshots and captured output is helpful.
1. Give a reproduction path.
1. Use proper grammar and proofread your question.
1. Respond to feedback.
1. Give thanks even if you didn't find the help you were hoping for.

Here is a good template to follow when asking a question:

> When working on assignment `A`, I was successfully able to do `1`, `2`, and `3`, but then I did `B`, as instructed by `C`, and got the result `D`, with an error of `E`. I was expecting `F`. I thought maybe `G` or `H` might be the problem, but I saw that `J` already tried that without success as discussed here on `K`. Any help is greatly appreciated.

## Deviating from the course tools

ðŸš§ Warning: Proceed at Your Own Risk ðŸš§

When asking questions, the TA, professor, and your peers will assume you are using the course tools as defined by the course. This includes having installed all the required plugins, packages, and programs. If you choose to deviate from that path, you are on your own to resolve any issues that arise from your divergence.

## Pay it forward

Always remember how it felt to receive help. Actively look for opportunities to help others in a kind respectful way. After all, that is the Gospel of Jesus Christ at its core. We are a team. We are better together.

## â˜‘ Exercise

Get on the Discord server and review each of the channels and the TA area. Change your display name to be your actual name. Review the previous instruction on asking questions. Give some thought about proper forum etiquette.

Figure out who your assigned TA is by reviewing the [TA schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n0Z6sARR29lZRwoGzTYxqSiGV6s1vPSa4ddFE0Jh9j8). TAs are assigned by an alphabetical range. Find the range that contains the first letter of your last name. Using their Discord ID, open Discord to send them a direct message (DM) to introduce yourself.
