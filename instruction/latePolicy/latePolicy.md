# Late Policy

Your success in this course is primarily based upon timely execution. Staying on track results in an enjoyable, positive experience. Once you get behind in the course, it is extremely difficult to catch up.

To help you stay current with the rest of the class, we will implement the following late policy:

## Late Submissions

Late submissions receive **zero** points.

## Grace Days

Each student begins the semester with **two grace day**. Grace days allow you to submit a deliverable past the assigned due date for full credit. Each grace day covers one day late, excluding Sundays. For deliverables submitted for a [Canvas assignment](https://byu.instructure.com), any grace days that are used will be deducted by the TA grading the assignment.

The grader applies grace days to every late submission made, even submissions that earn partial credit. If you need to resubmit, the TA will track how many grace days you have already applied for that assignment. This means you can resubmit multiple times on the same day without using additional late days for each submission.

You will receive a **zero** on all late submissions if the days late exceeds the grace days available, in which case, any available grace days will not be applied to that submission. For example, if you have two grace days and submit three days late, you will receive zero points but still have two grace days for a future assignment.

The one exception to the grace day policy is the **university deadline on the last day of instruction**. All work must be submitted by that time, with all missing work receiving a **zero** afterwards.

We encourage you to submit all work even if it is late. Most deliverables depend upon the previous ones in order to be successful, and you will gain helpful feedback for each submission, even if it earns zero points.

## Earning Grace Days

To encourage you to stay ahead of the course, and handle the inevitable sickness, family emergency, powder day, or accident, you can earn grace days.

For each day that a deliverable is submitted early, and receives 100%, Sundays excluded, you earn 1 grace day, up to a maximum of 2 per deliverable.

You can view your available grace days on the `Grace Days` assignment in Canvas.

## Extenuating Circumstances and Accommodations

Life happens, sometimes in ways we cannot foresee or prepare for. If you encounter an extenuating circumstance or require university accommodations during the semester, please contact the professor as soon as possible. University Accommodations require you to ask the Professor for extensions **before** the deadline.
